<h2>EXE Compiler - Readme</h2>
<h5>.: Introduction</h5>
This code sample demonstrates how to create your own exe files.
<p>
Not a direct approach. The program writes to the end of an existing 
exe file. The exe file can then access this data and work with it.
<p>
The compiled exe does not require any extra files for working
(except the vb runtimes, of course!)

<h5>.: In more detail... :.</h5>
prjRdfce.vbp is the program (when compiled) that acts as the template
for the exe. It is compiled to 'rdfce.ext'. <br>
prjExeCompiler is the program used to create new exe files. It first
makes a copy of rdfce.ext to the file name supplied by the user, say
test.exe. It then writes user supplied data to the end of test.exe.<br>
When test.exe is run, it reads the data contained in itself and work
accordingly (all that code is done in prjRdfce)
<p>
Hopefully, that explains the working.

<h5>.: Uses :.</h5>
For creating apps like self extracting archives, stand alone photo album,
etc etc. If you have done something with it then please write to me.
